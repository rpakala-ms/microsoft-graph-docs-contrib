## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /servicePrincipals/{id}/memberOf
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response, including `$select`, `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter`. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the directoryRoles the user is a member of. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** property. The default and maximum page sizes are 100 and 999 objects respectively.

## Request headers

| Name       | Type | Description|
|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using the `$search`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, or OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that might not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.
